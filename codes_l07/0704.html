<!-- HTML event handler attributes
Event handlers typically have names that begin with on, for example, the event handler for the click event is onclick.

To assign an event handler to an event associated with an HTML element, you can use an HTML attribute with the name of the event handler.  -->
<input type="button" value="Save" onclick="showAlert()">

<!-- DOM Level 0 event handlers
Each element has event handler properties such as onclick. To assign an event handler, you set the property to a function as shown in the example: -->
<input type="button" id="btn" value="Edit">
</body>
<script src="0704.js"></script>
