<!-- An event is an action that occurs in the web browser, which the web browser feedbacks to you so that you can respond to it.
For example, when users click a button on a webpage, you may want to respond to this click event by displaying a dialog box.
Each event may have an event handler which is a block of code that will execute when the event occurs.
An event handler is also known as an event listener. It listens to the event and executes when the event occurs. -->
